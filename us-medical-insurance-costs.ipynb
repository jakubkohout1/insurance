    "\n",

    "The one exeption is the trend from Class 2 Obesity to Class 3 Obesity. In this catagory we see a decrease in both average insurance cost (Step 1) and average percent cost difference of simlar people (Step 2). \n",

    "In Step 1, the sample size is considarably lower for Class 3 Obsity than all but the Underweight catagory. In addition the Average Cost is only slightly lower than teh Average Cost of Class 2 Obesity. \n",
    "These two facts combine would seem to accound for the lapse in positive corrilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Step 2 however the average sample size is similar across all bmi catagories and the drop in Cost Percent Difference from Class 2 to Class 3 is quite dramatic. Therefore it could be warrented to further explore\n",
    "this sample to identify any other trends across the Class 2 and Class 3 Catagories that might contribute to this outlier in the positive coorilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "BMI is a Weight/Height ratio that was created with a goal of assessing the fat to body mass propotions. This goal is made clear by the names of the catagories given to different level of BMI. Each name clearly implies\n",
